# Reflections

## Participation

- 3 groups 6-8 people in size

## What Happened

- shared screen from the beginning to show google colab notebook
- opened the floor for questions and got a few questions from
  participants
- multiple participants had questions about what a csv is, and what a delimiter
  refers to
  - one group pulled up the csv in a text editor to show the contents
- how to choose which way to read in files
  (is all my data numeric, or strings, etc.)
  influences whether numpy is the appropriate choice
- slicing that removes a dimension versus slices that keep all dimensions was
  a confusing topic
- questions about proper use cases for using slices
- introduce considerations of the amount of data youâ€™re working on
  (example was voxel arrays)
- trade-offs among storing intermediate results in memory, vs recomputing
  time-consuming intermediate results when they would have fit in memory,
- illustrate the coding style tradeoffs between nesting/composition
  and sequentially saving results
- increased interest in the shell commands at the top of the notebook
- lots of emphasis placed on axis=0 being rows, and axis=1 being columns
- talked about position of arguments in a function, and how
  changing the order created errors
- one group did a round robin to ask questions and it appeared
  to help with engagement (cold calling does not work for all learners however)

## Take-Away(s)

- keep sharing screen from beginning
- demonstrate working with data in a familiar interface (excel)
  before moving to python
- try a mix of asking the crowd and doing round robin question asking
  to hear from everyone? (or have another strategy to hear from everyone,
  like a quota?)
- Encourage participants to practice coding outside of CoLab.
- It might be beneficial to remind/encourage participants to type code into cell instead of just running code or copy and pasting code.
