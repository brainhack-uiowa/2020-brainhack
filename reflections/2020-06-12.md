# Reflections

## Participation

- 2 groups 7 people in size

## What Happened

- one group got done early and the other late
  - mostly from eagerness of the group to discuss
- questions about opaque functions such as `range` and `enumerate` arose
  (since they are not covered in depth in the lesson)
- there were questions about real life application of concepts
- some questions about the danger of mutability/immutability



## Take-Away(s)

- think of/find real world examples for applications of concepts (for loops/lists/numpy arrays)
- if discussion is not starting, go through one of the example exercises and ask
  for help from the participants to complete the exercise.
  - this can reveal gaps in understanding and promote discussion
- encourage audience to try to think from the code author's perspective
  - eventually want them to reason through why code is written in a certain way
  - this is potentially a more advanced method of breaking down problems into constituate parts
    to think of a solution yourself.
- continue to be cognizant of time since we are covering more material
