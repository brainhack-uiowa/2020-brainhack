# Reflections

## Participation

- 3 groups 5-7 people in size

## What Happened

- stated that there is a difference between the stately (matlab) or object-oriented (pythonic) approach to using matplotlib
- stated there are a lot of libraries that use matplotlib to make more advanced figures easily
- groups looked up documentation or googled questions to showcase how find solutions
- groups explored function arguments that made the plots
  - one group explained `**kwargs` at a high level
- described the [anatomy of a matplotlib figure](https://matplotlib.org/3.2.1/gallery/showcase/anatomy.html)
  - specifically focused on the difference between figure and axes
- one group went round robin asking participants to edit one line of code each to complete an exercise.
- groups walked through how make the same plots in the assignment
  using either [altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) or [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Take-Away(s)

- meet your audience where they're at, if they are all familiar with another programming language
  you can often move at a faster pace since they probably know underlying programming concepts, but
  are unfamiliar with the syntax
- related to the first point, suggest the participants to look for figures they like in the
  literature they read and find out what software is used.
- software carpentry focuses on brevity and concepts, those more experienced with python
  should identify missing practical suggestions users will run into when writing code related to the lesson.
- ask consent for doing round robin cold calling if you are using that as a strategy
  - make sure everyone knows it's okay if you do not know the answer
