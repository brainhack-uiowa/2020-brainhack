# Structure of Discussion


## -1: Throughout (spanning multiple weeks)

- Get an idea of where the audience is at:
  - do they know a programming language and are learning a new one
  - never written code before in their life
  - very practically minded and need to accomplish tasks
  - curious about the messy internals of python

## 0: Welcoming Banter

- Log in a few minutes early to talk about life/catch up and share

## 1: Introductory Check-in

- Ask the audience how the pacing is going, if there was too much or too little material being
  covered this week.

## 2: Overview of Material

- Go over the key points of the material being covered this week
- Mention real world importance of learning the key points
- Cover any known gotcha's that are known
  - e.g., matplotlib has two plotting interfaces, one that is more matlab oriented
    and other that is more python oriented

## 3: Break Out Ice Breaker

- Go into smaller groups if applicable
- Go around and have everyone say something cool they learned this week
- Could be any other activity that allows the participant to unmute themselves and speak
  with a relatively easy question to answer

## 4: Consent for teaching style (any pedogological tricks)

- If you want to use a teaching device:
  - calling on people round robin style
  - suggest everyone talk two times
  - using the zoom checks and x's
- Ask if it's all right and if applicable, demo how to
  use the teaching device

## 5a: Open the floor for questions

- Share your screen so everyone can see the notebook you are working on
- Ask if anyone has questions about the material, or if they had difficulty with an exercise
- If someone has a question you do not know the answer to:
  - post the question on the slack group, demoing good practices on how to make a reproducible example
  - google it, demo good practices on how to search for information
- If a question feels like it leads to a particularly deep rabbit hole,
  thank the person for the question and say you will cover it at the end
  if there is time, and if not, follow up through slack to share resources/
  discuss the topic.

## 5b: Walk through the material interactively (optional, could go to directly to 6)

- If there are no questions, start walking through the material
- Tie material to real world examples (if you have personal experience)
- If people are likely to be familiar with another piece of software (e.g., excel),
  demo how the data/process looks like in that software before showing it
  in python
  - while showing it in python, draw the explicit parallels.
- Change some of the lesson code and break it/change the output
  - talk about the error message
  - talk about why it broke/changed
- If applicable, ask why the python code works that way
  - offer examples on how it could have done differently
    (or how it has been done differently in other programming languages)
- check in with the audience every 5-10 minutes either through:
  - explicitly asking if the material made sense
  - asking them to help you fill out some code

## 6: Interactively Test Understanding

- Walk through one of the exercises asking the audience to help you fill out the answer
  - let the audience choose to participate, or
  - call on people (based on whatever strategy you've outlined at the beginning)
