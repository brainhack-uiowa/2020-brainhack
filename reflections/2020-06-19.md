# Reflections

## Participation

- 2 groups 7 people in size

## What Happened

- one group got done early and the other late
- brought up the concept of wide/long datasets
- emphasized differences between lists/numpy arrays/pandas dataframes
  - namely, the `+` operator works differently in lists and numpy arrays
  - if you do not specify an axis with pandas, it assumes `axis=0`, but in numpy, it will attempt
    to do the operation over all axes
- real world examples were brought up when thinking about applications of lessons
- first person reported technical difficulties when trying to open the notebook
  - [possibly related](https://github.com/googlecolab/colabtools/issues/1102)
- lamented the poor `groupby` demonstration (makes the most sense with grouping data in long format?)
- talked about use cases for long and wide data
- talked about uses for `index_col` in pandas
- how masks work within pandas (and the step by step logic behind using them to get subsections of the dataframe)
- head/tail methods and attributes of data frames.

## Take-Away(s)

- be cognizant of time
- continue showcasing errors/mistakes as learning experiences
- continue checking in with audience in 5/10 minutes intervals
  - takes the form of asking them to help you complete an exercise
  - or if the concept being covered made sense
- perhaps try quota system for participation?
