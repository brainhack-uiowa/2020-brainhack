# Reflections

## Participation

- 1 group 11 people in size

## What Happened

- covered type coersion using an exercise
- talked about floating point representation
- talked about sorting non numerical values
- showed an example file from numpy
- showcased errors and how to closely read a line of code
- talked about real world examples
- mentioned how the checks in the software carpentry example were arbitrary and
  did not exactly match real world use cases

## Take-Away(s)

- keep up real world examples
- send poll at beginning to check in
- go over key points from the lessons
- ice breaker for everyone to mention something exciting or cool they learned
- still need to figure out how to do checkins during the conversation
