# Brainhack 2020

## Abstract

Most researchers are unable to collect new data due to the pandemic.
Instead, researchers must rely on digital mountains of open data sources and/or already collected data to
make progress on their projects.
Trainees and early career researchers need powerful tools to aggregate, explore, and analyze their data.
Coupled with the cancellation of summer workshops to train researchers,
there is an increased need to support those individuals as they learn how to use powerful tools.
The brainhack committee seeks to support researcher's learning this summer through an 8 week series
of python tutorials focused on providing the fundamental skills for data analysis, and
preparing a subset of the participants for a virtual neuroscience summer course, [neuromatch academy](https://neuromatch.io/academy/).
The goals of this 8 week series are two-fold: **1**, we hope to provide an adequately paced, interactive introduction to python that inspires confidence in participants
to take the lessons they learn and apply them to their own data and **2**, we hope to create a community of early career researchers/trainees/research support staff
to provide open communication between the needs of researchers and services provided by research support staff.


## Project Plan

### Location & Timeline

The event will take place May 18th-July 10th, 2020 through zoom.
On each Monday starting May 18th, we will release an interactive tutorial (via [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/))
for participants to work on.
Throughout the week, as participants hit roadblocks and run into questions, we will encourage them to
post on our slack group so that other participants or python "experts" can answer the questions.
On each Friday (3-5pm) starting May 22nd, we will host a discussion via zoom briefly covering the main concepts
on that week's tutorial, and open discussion for participants to share and get past their roadblocks.
Near the end of the training, we will introduce participants to [IDAS](https://hpc.uiowa.edu/resources-and-services/interactive-data-analytics-service-idas),
and encourage them to sign up for the service so they can apply their new python knowledge to their own data.

The scope and pacing of the material will be flexible depending on the average learning speed of the participants,
and explicitly asking for feedback on pacing as the tutorials progress.
